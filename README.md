# K-Nearest-Neighbors
this repository is created to learn how implement KNN on specific purpose


Requirement:
1.python      = as Programming language

2.pandas      = as data manipulation

3.matplotlib  = as data visualization

4.seaborn     = as data visualization too (Require import matplotlib to use this module)

5.numpy       = for matrix manipulation

6.sklearn     = as KNN algorithm framework


you can install all in once by using this step, but you must install python 3.x.x first!:
1. open terminal / cmd inside this file directory, then type this following syntax
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. that all, enjoy!
