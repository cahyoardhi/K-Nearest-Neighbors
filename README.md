# K-Nearest-Neighbors
this repository is created to learn how implement KNN on specific purpose\n

Requirements:\n
python      = as Programming language\n
pandas      = as data manipulation\n
matplotlib  = as data visualization\n
seaborn     = as data visualization too (Require import matplotlib to use this module)\n
numpy       = for matrix manipulation\n
sklearn     = as KNN algorithm framework\n

you can install all in once by using this step, but you must install python 3.x.x first!:\n

1. open terminal / cmd inside this file directory, then type this following syntax\n
2. pip install -r requirements.txt\n
3. that all, enjoy!\n
